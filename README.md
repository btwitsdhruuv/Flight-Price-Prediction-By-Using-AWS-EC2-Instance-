# Flight-Price-Prediction-By-Using-AWS-EC2-Instance- 
This project was challenging for me because all independent features were of categorical type. To convert it into numerical values LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoding were required. Also using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest Regressor And Hyperparameter Tunning Techniques Like RandomizedSearchCV were applied and was successfully deployed on AWS EC2 Instance Cloud Platform
